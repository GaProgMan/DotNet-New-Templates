# Purpose Of This Document

I wanted to put this document together to ensure there are answers to some of the frequent questions guests ask about being interviewed for The .NET Core Podcast. Hopefully, this document will provide answers to any questions that you have and provide a little insight into the process of being interviewed for the show.

My thanks go out to [Love Sudo Nimh](https://twitter.com/joseyhowarth) for helping with the formatting and general language used in this document.

## Do I Need Any Specific Equipment?

You will need:

* a microphone
* a pair of headphones, earphones, or a form of audio monitor
* a PC, laptop, or similar
* a web browser

I usually conduct interviews using the SquadCast software-as-a-service platform. I have found this to be more stable than using other VoIP methods (i.e. Skype), as SquadCast records locally and streams to the cloud. It also keeps each vocal track separately, that way I can tweak each audio track (i.e. remove any background noise) from one track without affecting the others.

One thing to note about SquadCast is that the default UI includes a map with a vague geo-location of all participants. This can be disabled on a per-guest basis by blocking the geo-location services API when it is requested, this will not affect the quality of the recording. However, according to their support channels, using a VPN may cause issues with the recording. If this is likely ot cause an issue, we can arrange another way of performing the interview.

SquadCast will also ask for video permissions. Video footage will not be used for the recording, as such it is recommended to not share video. Doing so will require more bandwidth, and could potentially affect the recording.

Having headphones, earphones or some other form of audio monitor will ensure that there is no audio feedback from a combination of the speakers that your computer uses and the microphone that you are using.

## How Will You Arrange The Interview?

Typically, I will arrange the interview date and time via email.

I tend to favour finding a date and time which is convenient for the person(s) I am interviewing. As such, it may take a few rounds of emailing in order to pick the most convenient time.

Once the date and time have been confirmed, I will send a calendar invite to each person who will be interviewed. The calendar invite will contain a request for a bio, instructions on how to access the SquadCast recording session, and a small selection of questions or topics for the interview.

## Will I Need To Prepare a Bio?

I appreciate that summarising oneâ€™s self can be quite daunting. However, I will prepare a basic one for you, based on my research of your online projects or the topic that we will discuss. The version that I supply is entirely changeable. You can either supply a completely different bio, supply amendments (which I will happily make), or approve the version that I have written.

Examples of past bios include:

> In this episode of The .NET Core Podcast, I talk with Steve Gordon about some of his deep dives into the .NET Core source code. You may know Steve from his incredibly accessible deep dive blog posts over at his blog (https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/), or the .NET South East meetup group (which he started, over at: https://www.meetup.com/dotnetsoutheast/) or for his work on The Humanitarian Toolbox (http://www.htbox.org/)

The above is an example of a bio that I had written, but which was accepted as-is by the interviewee (in this case Steve Gordon).

> In this episode I interviewed Steve Smith about design patterns, and how you can leverage them in your ASP.NET Core application. Steve - also known as Ardalis - has been a Microsoft MVP since 2002, has published numerous courses on both PluralSight and DevIQ, and runs the Weekly Dev Tips podcast. He's an entrepreneur and offers mentoring for teams and individuals who want to develop better software.

The above example was supplied to me by Steve Smith for his episode.

## What Kinds Of Questions Will Be Asked?

I see you as an expert in the field that I am discussing with you, as such I will be asking you questions about
your chosen field and how it relates to either:

* .NET Core
* ASP.NET Core
* EF Core
* SignalR
* etc.

(please forgive the impersonal nature of the previous sentence)

As such, I will often "play dumb" with the specific subject matter or try to relate it to a metaphor or some other technology. In this respect, I am attempting to represent the audience, who may or may not have heard of the technology or field that you are representing.

I will make sure to include in the calendar invite several example questions, but these are more of a guide as to what we might discuss. An example set of questions would be:

* Could you please introduce yourself to the listeners?
* Would you mind talking a little about the book that you have written on ASP.NET Core?
* Your blog posts seem to be both incredibly useful and very specific. Are they based on specific issues that you have faced in your everyday development?
* I was wondering if we could talk a little about the ASP NET Core middleware pipeline?
  * how is it different to the way that ASP NET handles requests?
  * how extensible is it? Can listeners create their own middleware classes?

(the above are example questions which were sent over to Andrew Lock for his interview on ASP.NET Core)

The actual interview will be more free form than just the questions that I send over, they might form the basis of the conversation or they may not even be used. They are also subject to interviewee approval, as such you can choose that we discuss a different branch of the topic, or not cover any of the questions at all.

## How Long Will The Interview Last?

When you receive the calendar invite, the start and end times will indicate that I have blocked out around 60-90 minutes of your time.

The interview will not last for 90 minutes. The reason I block out that much time is to ensure that we have time for a sound check and a light chat at the beginning of the session, along with a conversation about when I am planning to release the episode at the end of the session.

The entire session should take no longer than around 50 minutes of your time, and the recorded portion of that should be around 40-45 minutes long.

You are free to take as much time as you may need in order to answer a question. Similarly, if you find that you would like to "start over" with your answer to a question, you need only ask.

## Will I Receive a Copy Of The Interview Before It Goes Live?

I will contact you once editing is completed and will offer a pre-live version of the episode. This is so that you can go through it and let me know of any further edits you would like me to make (i.e. remove the long "um" at 39 minutes).

As my release schedule is rather agile in its nature, I would need notes back from you as soon as possible. This is because I release episodes to Patreon subscribers before releasing them via the standard RSS feed. The lead time between releasing to Patreon and releasing to the public RSS feed is usually a few days but can be up to a week.
