### Classic Episode From The Vault

##### Episode 11 - Securing Your Apps Using Lizzie with Thomas Hansen

This episode was an incredilby in depth discussion with Thomas about his (then) brand new programming paradigm of Lizzie, which allowed you to create WebApi applications without having to worry about the security implications inherant in creating them.

Full show notes, including text snippets from the episode and an embedded player are available [here](https://dotnetcore.show/episode-11-but-what-is-lizzie/)

<p style="text-align: right;"><em>As with the episode with Pablo, look out for a new episode with Thomas in the near future</em></p>

### Places You Can Meet/See Me

I don't currently have any speaking engagements lined up, but I'm looking at a number of (UK based) conferences and meetups that I'd like to attend. I'll keep this portion of the newsletter updated (in later editions) with the list of places events that I'll be attending, and if you're around then find me and say hi. I like to think that I'm an approachable sort of chap - and I might have some swag to give away.

If you’re at all interested in having me speak at your event, then please get in touch. The best way is to follow me on Twitter and send me a DM (they’re always open).
