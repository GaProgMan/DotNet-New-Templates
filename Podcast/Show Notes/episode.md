Hello everyone and welcome to THE .NET Core podcast - the only podcast which is devoted to:

### Wrapping Up

//#if (is-interview)
That was my interview with PERSONS_NAME of (Company Name). Be sure to check out the show notes for a bunch of links to some of the stuff that we covered, and a collection of text snippets from the interview. The show notes, as always, can be found at [dotnetcore.show](https://dotnetcore.show/).

I'd hoped to keep this episode short, and it's been me talking at you for 20 minutes so far. Hopefully you've found this interesting, if you did then let me know by sending me a tweet [@dotnetcoreblog](https://twitter.com/dotnetcoreblog/) on Twitter, or head over to the website [dotnetcore.show](https://dotnetcore.show/) and let me know what you think.

Remember to check the show notes for a link to the full transcription of this episode, which is available at [dotnetcore.show](https://dotnetcore.show/).

I will see you again some time soon. See you later folks.

And don't forget to spread the word, leave me a rating or review on your podcatcher of choice, and to come back next time for more .NET Core goodness.

I will see you again real soon. See you later folks.
